## Scenario 1: Designing a Mobile Health App for Diabetic Patients
1️ Identifying & Writing Problem Statements
User Pain Points Identified:
Users forget to log health data consistently.
The app UI is confusing or overly technical.
No personalized health insights or reminders.

Problem Statement 1:
“Busy diabetic patients need a way to consistently track their health metrics because current apps are cluttered and hard to use, which results in irregular data logging and poor health management.”

Problem Statement 2:
“Middle-aged users with diabetes need a way to receive timely health reminders because they often forget due to busy schedules, which results in missed medication and health risks.”

2️ Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
Recommended Research Methods:
In-depth Interviews: Understand users’ emotional and lifestyle challenges.
Diary Studies: Observe real-world behavior over 7–14 days.
Usability Testing: Test ease of logging data and understanding graphs.
Justification: These methods help uncover:
How often users forget or skip logging.
Whether app design supports their routine.
Emotional and real-life frustrations of managing a chronic condition.
