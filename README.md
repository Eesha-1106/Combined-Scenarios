## AIM:
# 1.Solution Ideation
Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app).

Task:
1.Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise.

2.Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

## 2.Creating User Stories
Use personas and their goals to write user stories.

Task:1. Write at least 5 user stories using this format:
   
2.As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

# 3.Creating Scenarios

1. Select a user story.

Task:
1.Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context.

2.Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.
## 4.Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping
1.Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app).

Task:
1.Draw a task flow diagram or user flow.

2.Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).
## 5.Information Architecture (IA)

1.Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal).

Task:
1.Perform card sorting (open or closed).
2.Create a site map showing categorized structure.

## 1. Solution Ideation
```
Method: Crazy 8s (quickly sketch 8 ideas in 8 minutes)
Problem: Booking an appointment in a hospital app
Low-fidelity Ideas (Sketch concepts):
1.	Quick Book Tile Grid: Grid of doctors/specialties with 1-tap booking.
2.	Voice Assistant Booking: User speaks "Book a cardiologist for tomorrow" to initiate.
3.	Smart Chatbot: Conversational AI flow to ask symptoms and suggest doctors/time.
4.	Swipe to Book: Tinder-like UI for appointment slots based on preference.
5.	Symptom Checker Integration: Input symptoms → suggested departments → instant booking.
6.	Calendar Overlay: Select date → available doctors/specialties appear as options.
7.	Location-Based Suggestions: Nearby hospital/clinic with open slots shown first.
8.	Emergency Mode: Red button that bypasses booking, calls the nearest hospital.

## 2. Creating User Stories
```
Personas Used:
•	Priya, 29, working professional, wants to book appointments fast.
•	Ravi, 56, less tech-savvy, prefers simple interfaces.
•	Amit, 19, student, looks for affordable/free clinics.
•	Farah, 40, caregiver booking for her elderly parents.
•	Neha, 35, has anxiety and prefers fewer steps.
User Stories:
1.	As a busy professional, I want to book a doctor in under 2 minutes, so that I don’t miss work.
2.	As a senior user, I want to see large, clear buttons, so that I don’t get confused.
3.	As a student, I want to filter by low-cost clinics, so that I can stay within budget.
4.	As a caregiver, I want to book on behalf of someone else, so that my parents can get timely care.
5.	As a user with anxiety, I want to avoid calling or talking, so that I feel comfortable booking appointments.

## 3. Creating Scenarios
```
Selected User Story:
As a caregiver, I want to book on behalf of someone else, so that my parents can get timely care.
Scenario Narrative:
Farah, 40, is at home on a Sunday morning. Her father, who has diabetes, complains of blurry vision. Farah opens the hospital app on her tablet, looking worried but calm. She needs to find an eye specialist quickly. She selects “Book for Parent” mode and enters her father’s name. She sees available slots and filters by morning times. With relief, she finds a 10:30 AM slot at a nearby clinic and confirms the booking. Her emotional state transitions from anxious to reassured as the app sends a confirmation SMS to both her and her father.

## 5. Information Architecture (IA)
```
Example: University Website
Card Sorting Activity (Open Sort Sample Results):
•	Participants grouped items like:
o	Admissions, Programs, Scholarships → Admissions
o	Faculty, Departments, Research → Academics
o	News, Events, Student Life → Campus Life
Resulting Site Map:
